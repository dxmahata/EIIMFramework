# A Framework for Collecting, Ranking and Managing Event Identity Information From Social Media

This is the code base for a framework currently being developed by me. The framework is a major part of my PhD research work at Center for Entity Resolution and Information Quality, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. This code base consists of a portion of the framework and the full framework is patent pending (US patent).

Details would be shared through academic publications in different conferences and journals.
